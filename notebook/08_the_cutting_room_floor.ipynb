    "\n",
    "So, slicing.\n",
    "I knew we'd get to this soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll be interesting to see how this interacts with the complex ownership rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn first_word(s: &String) -> usize {\n",
    "    let bytes = s.as_bytes();\n",
    "\n",
    "    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {\n",
    "        if item == b' ' {\n",
    "            return i;\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    s.len()\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So this seems to create a byte array and look though it for a space.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm guessing `as_bytes()` is implicitly passing ownership to the caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "As much as I don't like looking at UTF-8 as bytes, it should be reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The highest bit will be set for multipart characters so it will not match space.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few interesting things:\n",
    " * A type capable of iterating can not automatically be used in a `for` loop, it needs the `.iter()` method.\n",
    "    * Python has spoiled me a lot in this regard. Their loops just work without the additional method call.\n",
    " * Even that isn't enough, it **also** needs `.enumerate()`. I don't know why.\n",
    "    * Ah I see it's keeping track of the loop position as well as item for the return.\n",
    " * Why do we need the 'b' in `b' '`, is there anything else a single quote could mean?\n",
    " * It seems `i` is automatically assigned as `usize`.\n",
    "    * I don't think the loop index can be anything else?\n",
    "\n",
    "## [String Slices](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-03-slices.html#string-slices)\n",
    "\n",
    "They have a pretty standard slicing syntax:\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "    let s = String::from(\"hello world\");\n",
    "    let hello = &s[0..5];\n",
    "    let world = &s[6..11];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A thoughts:\n",
    " * I assume this is a byte index. It doesn't look unicode safe.\n",
    "    * Slicing after an ASCII space should be fine.\n",
    "    * Slicing arbitrarily it likely to cause UTF-8 decoding errors.\n",
    "    * The tutorial does later acknowledge this., but solutions aren't until chapter eight.\n",
    "    * A unicode BOM would likely be accidently included with the previous function.\n",
    " * Range operators are `[first...(last+1)]`, so `2..5` = `2, 3, 4`.\n",
    "    * Can also do standard slice tricks like `s[n..]` meaning everything after and including the nth position.\n",
    "    * Also `s[..n]` for everything before the nth position.\n",
    "    * Strangly also `s[..]` for a slice of the whole thing.\n",
    "        * Is that different from a reference???\n",
    "        * Seems to be as slices have a different type.\n",
    "    * Methods like `.clear()` require mutability.\n",
    " * Slices operate as a kind of view on the object.\n",
    " * They have a different type, they're recorded as `&str` rather than the `&String` type.\n",
    " \n",
    "I understand the benefits of this, though maybe they didn't need to boast at the end of the section.\n"

    "## [String Literals as Slices](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-03-slices.html#string-literals-as-slices)\n",
    "String literal are just slices from the binary!\n",
    "\n",
    "This seems to be the reason why user generated slices from `String` have the same `str` type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which means modifying slices would need a copy in a new memory location initialize with `String::from()` right???\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn first_word(s: &String) -> &str { }\n",
    "\n",
    "fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str { }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial says the second function signature would be more versatile.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often we'd be working with the `str` type and `String` can be easily converted with slicing.\n",
    "They gave an example:\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "    let my_string = String::from(\"hello world\");\n",
    "    let word = first_word(&my_string[0..6]);\n",
    "    let word = first_word(&my_string[..]);\n",
    "```\n",
