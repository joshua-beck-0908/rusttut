This means s1 in Listing 8-18 will be moved into the add call and will no longer be valid after that. So, although let s3 = s1 + &s2; looks like it will copy both strings and create a new one, this statement actually takes ownership of s1, appends a copy of the contents of s2, and then returns ownership of the result. In other words, it looks like it‚Äôs making a lot of copies, but it isn‚Äôt; the implementation is more efficient than copying.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh I¬†see. So it is reusing the buffer of the first string for some efficiency gains, which is why it takes ownership of the first one but not the second.\n",
