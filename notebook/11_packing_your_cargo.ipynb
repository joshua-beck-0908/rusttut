    "I like my name better.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm keen to learn how Rust managaes packages and scope. \n",
    " - How do you choose what methods or variables should be exposed?\n",
    " - What naming conventions should I be following?\n",
    " - How do I separate internal and external imports?\n",
    " - How do these 'crates' work?\n",
    " \n",
    "## [Packages and Crates](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-01-packages-and-crates.html#packages-and-crates)\n",
    "Crates are:\n",
    " - The smallest unit, a single file.\n",
    " - Either binary or library.\n",
    "    - Binaries crates have a main function and work independently.\n",
    "    - Library crates do not have a main function and work with a program.\n",
    " - Often 'crate' will be used interchangably with 'library' in Rust.\n",
    " - Binary creates have a 'crate root', the entry file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Packages are:\n",
    " - One or more crates bundled together.\n",
    " - Work to provide a set of functionality.\n",
    " - Have a 'Cargo.toml' file to setup the build.\n",
    " - Can contain many binary crates **but only one library crate**.\n",
    " - Must always have at least one crate.\n",
    " - The default root crate is the 'src/main.rs' file.\n",
    "    - Additional files can be put in 'src/bin/'.\n",
    " - The default library crate is 'src/lib.rs'\n",
    " - The default package name is the name of the parent directory.\n",
    " \n",
    "Seems pretty straightforward so far.\n",

    "\n",
    "Rules for modules:\n",
    " * Crates start from the crate root of 'src/lib.rs' or 'src/main.rs'.\n",
    " * Modules are declared as `mod module_name;` and are defined as:\n",
    "    * The code in the {} brackets following the declaration (if present).\n",
    "    * The 'src/module_name.rs' file.\n",
    "    * The 'src/module_name/mod.rs' file.\n",
    " * It doesn't seem like inline modules would usually be very desirable? You'd want to split up the code.\n",
    " * Module files can contain own submodules.\n",
    " * Submodules are accessed with: `crate::module_name::sub_module_name`.\n",
    " * Everything in a module is private by default (including submodules) unless the `pub` keyword is used.\n",
    "    * It's really nice to have that by default.\n",
    "    * What about members of an enum or struct, is `pub` all or nothing?\n",
    " * The `use` keyword lets you shorten long paths.\n",
    "    * I already did this in the previous program adding `use std::f64::consts::PI;` lets you use just 'PI' by itself.\n",

    "They gave the example contents of a library's 'src/lib.rs' file:\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "mod front_of_house {\n",
    "    mod hosting {\n",
    "        fn add_to_waitlist() {}\n",
    "\n",
    "        fn seat_at_table() {}\n",

    "Is the filename of the library taken into account? \n",
    "\n",
    "Does it preceed the module names in the namespace?\n",
    "\n",
    "It sounds like it.\n",
    "\n",
    "They have confirmed that `crate` is the implicit parent module. \n",
    "\n",
    "I started to make a library modular for the maths of AM modulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, I did not yet know how to link the files together, so I put the module inline for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some thoughts:\n",
    " * Very strong encapsulation by default.\n",
    "   * As mention, all methods are automatically private.\n",
    "   * Making the parent class public does not make its members public.\n",
    "   * Neither does it make the members of the parent struct public.\n",
    "   * Is public/private the only distinction? Or are there friend classes of sort?\n",
    " * You can also do `use module::x as y` if you don't like the default name.\n",
    "   * I did `use std::f64::consts::PI as Π;` because it makes mathematical formulae look a lot nicer.\n",
    "      * I'm not sure how to feel about the lack of automatic promotion of ints to floats.\n",
    " * Unicode systems worked properly in names."

    "I wrote nearly three hundred lines for this modulation library:\n",
    " * This was probably more of an undertaking that in would be in a more familiar language.\n",
